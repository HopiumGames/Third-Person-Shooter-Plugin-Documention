# Third-Person-Shooter-Plugin-Documention
Elevate your game development with our comprehensive Third-Person Shooter Template for Godot! Ideal for developers aiming to streamline their process, this addon provides a robust foundation for crafting exhilarating shooter games. Here you can find the future documentation.

Features:

    Inventory System: Effortlessly create resource-based items and pickups with our item pick-up template and Item Class resource. 

    Resource-Based Weapons: Experience dynamic weapon handling and editing in the Godot editor. Edit weapon data, and preview how weapons will be held by your 3D character in the Godot editor, even before they've been picked up. A handgun and an XM-29 OICW Rifle (for you 90s nostalgic fans) have been included for testing. 


    Component-Based Node Hierarchy: Enjoy an optimized and modular structure for easy customization and scalability. (Work in progress: some nodes still partially depend on and call sibling nodes to function.)

    Aiming and Firing Mechanics: Benefit from intuitive controls for precise targeting and shooting.
    Robust State Machine: Harness the power of the existing State Charts addon for a robust weapon and movement state machine.

    Exclusive Themed Mascot: Meet our Green Soldier  Guy, the perfect mascot to aid in prototyping your game. He uses modified Mixamo animations with the inclusion of a root bone and a shiny green plastic like material.


    Armor System: Add and remove armor and accessories with ease using Godot's Bone Attachment 3D. 


    Robust Animation Tree: we have modified mixamo animations to be compatible with the weapons the soldier guy holds for a better fit. Eventually we will capture our own animations completely replacing the mixamo ones. The Animation Tree will be adjusted in the future to allow for ease of adding new blend trees for each unique weapon type. For now adding multiple animations for different weapons is possible but a bit tedious.  

Whether you're an indie developer or part of a larger team, this template is designed to provide the tools and flexibility needed to create an engaging and polished third-person shooter. Dive in and start building your dream game today!

    Video Tutorials on how to use the Plugin with your own assets


Future:

In the future, we intend to release paid addons that are compatible with this plugin such as custom animations and compatible weapon packs 


How You May Use This in Your Project:

The Green Soldier Guy is our beloved mascot for this plugin and future ones. We’re quite fond of him, so he’s reserved for prototyping purposes only. We do not mind if you make development logs with him in it, but please don't distribute him in asset packs, sell him, or use him in any commercial products—he's meant to stay with us and help you build awesome game prototypes!

You may use this plugin in any commercial or personal video game that you desire, please review the license agreement here.
